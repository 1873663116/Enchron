# Transition Trace Arm

The operation arms the playback transition trace for the active session and optionally arms a presentation settlement fault. It requires that armTransitionTrace requires active playback, throwing when playbackRuntime.activeSessionID is absent, and that armTransitionTrace received an unsupported fault when the fault argument is not settlement-timeout. It records the logical session, settled and target presentations, and byte stream counters, and returns the generation token and capacity.
