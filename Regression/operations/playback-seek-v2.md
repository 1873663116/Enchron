# Playback Seek

The runtime Operation adapter taps the public PlayerPanel-progress track at the requested normalized offset through the controller's coordinateTap action, which the panel's single SpatialTapGesture routes to seekToTrack; it requires the product's own progress.seekToTrack probe line for every tap, corrects the residual left by the thumb-inset affine up to five times, and verifies that the same playback session, media identity and content revision settle at the target position. The progress bar's accessibilityAdjustableAction is a fixed fifteen-second step with a textual value and no normalized position, and the drag state machine is wearer-only, so neither is used.
